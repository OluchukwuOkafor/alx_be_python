# simple_interest.py
# This program calculates simple interest using the formula: I = P * R * T

# Define the variables
principal = 1000  # The principal amount ($)
rate = 0.05       # Annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3          # Time in years

# Calculate the simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
